## Flights

This scripts works on the flights data and tries to predict whether the given filght will be delayed or not. In this R script I have created multiple models to do the predictions and at the last a comparision of all the generated model. 

Here is the summary of the target dataset:

```{r dataset, echo=TRUE}
summary(dataset)
```

## Some plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
